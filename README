This is a python script that generates sheet music. It uses a random
number generator when picking the durations, pitches or chunks of notes
so that new notes are generated in each call, thus preventing learning
them by memory. Sight-reading can be practiced pretty well, the MIDI-
output generated along with the PDF may be used for checking the sight-
reading success.

For further information, take a look at the documentation in the docs
directory.

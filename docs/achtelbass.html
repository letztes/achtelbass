                <h3>How to use the program</h3>
                <p>At the moment the program can only be invoked from the
                command line. The appropriate command is
                <pre>$ python achtelbass.py</pre>
                All the parameters like intervals, range of pitches, etc. are
                hard coded. However, soon this values will be accepted as
                command line arguments.

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>The python scripts themselves produce only PMX code, which
                needs to be converted by PMX, the MusixTeX preprocessor, into
                the MusixTeX format. This in turn needs the MusixTeX program,
                which generates DVI files. Those can be displayed or printed
                directly, but probably one wants to convert them to PDF. So
                another program is required. Last, a viewer for PDF files is
                required in order to display the sheet music. For the
                optionally MIDI files a MIDI player is required.</p>
                <p>The software requirements are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Operating system</li>
                        <li>Python interpreter</li>
                        <li>PMX</li>
                        <li>MusixTeX (normally comes with PMX)</li>
                        <li>DVI to PDF converter (pdfdvi for instance)</li>
                        <li>PDF viewer (evince or so)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Translation of the GUI</h3>
                <p>The text on the buttons and in the menu of the GUI is
                loaded from a file called locales_xx.py, where xx stands
                for a two letter code. The file contains only a dictionary
                with the english terms as keys and the terms in the target
                language as values.
                If you wish to translate the application into a new
                language you first need to copy the file locales_template.py
                to locales_de.py in case the new language was german. Then
                you replace all the values in the dictionary with german
                terms for the corresponding items.
                When new widgets are introduced to the application or old
                ones are modified, the locales_template.py file and all the
                existing locales files need to be modified to.

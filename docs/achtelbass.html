            <h2>How to use the program</h2>
            <p>At the moment the program can only be invoked from the
            command line. The appropriate command is
            <pre>$ python achtelbass.py</pre>
            All the parameters like intervals, range of pitches, etc. are
            hard coded. However, soon this values will be accepted as
            command line arguments.

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>The python scripts themselves produce only PMX code, which
            needs to be converted by PMX, the MusixTeX preprocessor, into
            the MusixTeX format. This in turn needs the MusixTeX program,
            which generates DVI files. Those can be displayed or printed
            directly, but probably one wants to convert them to PDF. So
            another program is required. Last, a viewer for PDF files is
            required in order to display the sheet music. For the
            optionally MIDI files a MIDI player is required.</p>
            <p>The software requirements are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating system</li>
                    <li>Python interpreter</li>
                    <li>PMX</li>
                    <li>MusixTeX (normally comes with PMX)</li>
                    <li>DVI to PDF converter (pdfdvi for instance)</li>
                    <li>PDF viewer (evince or so)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h1>The Documentation</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Often when i explain to people what this program actually
            does they reply that they don't think that a computer
            program might be able to produce enjoyable music. I know
            that. I don't think that random generated thirds and fifths
            are likely to sound pleasureable and i never intended to
            prove this. The intention of this program never was to
            generate music, an attempt to do so would fail as inevitable
            as if one tried to generate lyric or prose by randomly 
            composing character bigrams and trigrams. Its absurd.<br />
            The intention of this program is to generate randomly
            arranged sheet music in order to practice sight reading.
            Various aspects like intervals, note values and tuplets may
            be added or disabled so one can practice purposeful those
            elements one needs.<br />
            Nevertheless, in future versions of this program i would
            like to add a machine learning component which will analyze
            pmx-files of sheet music from <a
            href="http://icking-music-archive.org/">
            http://icking-music-archive.org/</a> and other sources. In
            the next step this program will generate sheet music as
            initially intended, but it will prefer those combinations of
            chosen elements that were found more often during the learning
            process, thus yielding to a more enjoyable practice process.

                <h3>How to use the program</h3>
                <p>The program can be invoked in two ways.<br />
                From the command line:
                </p>
                <pre>$ python achtelbass.py</pre>
                <p>The following parameters can be passed as command
                line arguments:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tonic</li>
                    <li>Mode</li>
                    <li>Intervals</li>
                    <li>Inversion</li>
                    <li>Lowest pitch</li>
                    <li>Highest pitch</li>
                    <li>Rest frequency</li>
                    <li>Time signature</li>
                    <li>Note value</li>
                    <li>Tuplets</li>
                    <li>Same pitch in tuplet</li>
                    <li>Tuplets frequency</li>
                </ul>
                <p>None of them must be passed, any omitted parameter
                will be filled with a default value.
                </p>
                <p>To check out the exact syntax of passing parameter
                try</p>
                <pre>$ python achtelbass.py --help</pre>
                <p>The programm can be invoked within a graphical user
                interface too. The command line for launching the
                graphical user interface is:
                </p>
                <pre>$ python gachtelbass.py</pre>
                <img src="gachtelbass.py.png" alt="screenshot of gachtelbass.py UI" />
                <p>It is possible and probably desirable to have a web
                interface to achtelbass.
                </p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>The python scripts themselves produce only PMX code, which
                needs to be converted by PMX, the MusixTeX preprocessor, into
                the MusixTeX format. This in turn needs the MusixTeX program,
                which generates DVI files. Those can be displayed or printed
                directly, but probably one wants to convert them to PDF. So
                another program is required. Last, a viewer for PDF files is
                required in order to display the sheet music. For the
                optionally MIDI files a MIDI player is required.</p>
                <p>The software requirements are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating system</li>
                    <li>Python interpreter</li>
                    <li>PMX</li>
                    <li>MusixTeX (normally comes with PMX)</li>
                    <li>DVI to PDF converter (dvipdf for instance)</li>
                    <li>PDF viewer (evince or so)</li>
                    <li>MIDI player (timidity for example)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h3>Translation of the GUI</h3>
                <p>The text on the buttons and in the menu of the GUI is
                loaded from a file called locales_xx.py, where xx stands
                for a two letter code of the language in question. The file
                contains only a dictionary with the english terms as keys
                and the terms in the target language as values.<br />
                If you wish to translate the application into a new
                language you first need to make a copy the file
                locales_template.py, for instance
                to locales_de.py in case the new language was german. Then
                you replace all the values in the dictionary with german
                terms for the corresponding items.
                If you want to associate keyboard keys like 'F' for the
                file menu, all you have to do is to add an underscore right
                in front of that character that shall become the mnemonic
                character while editing the dictionary values.<br />
                <strong>Caveat when introducing new widgets.</strong> 
                When new widgets are introduced to the application or old
                ones are modified, the locales_template.py file and all the
                existing locales files need to be modified too.<br />
                However, this is only true for the accelerations with the
                ALT-key. The accelerations with the CTRL-key work
                different. They are bound to the key in question (e.g.
                'CTRL+S' for Save) in the code where the widget is 
                defined. Maybe one day there will be a second dictionary
                for those key bindings too.

                    <li>PMX cannot end an xtuplet with a rest. This is
                    exactly the error message it raises.
                    </li>
                    <li>Likewise, PMX cannot start a bar with a rest.</li>

                    too.</li>

                <h3>History of achtelbass</h3>
                <h4>achtelbass.yab</h4>
                <div>
                <p>
                The first Version of achtelbass i wrote in 2005 or 2006. The
                algorithm was implemented in yabasic and did not use oop nor
                did it use external programs like PMX and MusiXTeX. Instead
                it was written in a functional manner and dispayed the
                score all by itself, using the builtin graphics functions.
                The code is available <a href="achtelbass.yab">here</a>. You
                can run it with the yabasic interpreter. You need to invoke
                it from the command line, where the program asks you which
                key and which difficulty level to choose. After these 
                questions are answered, a graphical window pops up, showing
                the notes.</p>
                <p>
                The yabasic version featured four difficulty levels, where
                the lowest level displayed the letter names of the notes
                instead of the notes in and between the note lines. The
                note values were quarters only and the intervals were
                seconds only.</p>
                <p>
                The second difficulty level displayed the notes instead of
                the letters, but the intervals and the note values were the
                same as in the first level.</p>
                <p>
                In the third difficulty level the note values still
                consisted of quarters only, but the intervals consisted of 
                seconds and thirds and some few notes were replaced by
                rests.</p>
                <p>
                In the fourth difficulty level various intervals and note
                values were mixed and the range of pitches was extended
                beyond the five note lines.</p>
                <div style="text-align:center; padding:0px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px">
                    <img src="achtelbass.yab.png" alt="achtelbass.yab graphical output window at fourth difficulty level" />
                </div>
                <p>
                Note that in the image above the accidental in
                the f-major scale is a sharp in front of the 'a' and the
                half notes are displayed as filled circles. I never fixed
                that in the yabasic implementation, because at that time
                i began to learn Perl and wrote the program again from
                scratch.
                </p>
                </div>
                <h4>achtelbass.pl</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>About 2008 i wrote a perl script that worked similar
                    to the yabasic program but made use of MusixTeX. The
                    goal was to achieve pretty layout, which the TeX
                    programs are well known for.</p>
                    <p>
                    The implementation in Perl was invoked from the command
                    line and wrote the output into a file, that was read
                    afterwards by PMX, which called MusixTeX, which in turn
                    wrote a DVI file. After that DVI file was converted to
                    PDF the result could be viewed or printed. The complete
                    command line was:
                    </p>
                    <pre>perl achtelbass.pl &gt; out.pmx &amp;&amp; pmx out.pmx &amp;&amp; dvipdf out.dvi &amp;&amp; evince out.pdf</pre>
                    <p>The program did not take any parameters and did not
                    have a GUI. Any changes were to be made in the code
                    itself. The code is available 
                    <a href="achtelbass2pmx_einfach.pl">here</a> and 
                    <a href="achtelbass2pmx_sequenzen.pl">here</a>. The
                    former is simpler than the latter one, the latter uses
                    some more elaborated patterns in arranging the notes.

                    The items in the sheet music are limited to clef, key
                    and accidentals. Output format is in-window onscreen
                    drawing. Program reads keystrokes and matches them
                    to notes displayed in a computer game fashion.
                    Correct hit notes disappear, new randomly generated 
                    notes appear.

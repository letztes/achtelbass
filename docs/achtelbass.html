        <h1>The Documentation</h1>
        Needs to be written.
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>The python scripts themselves produce only PMX code, which needs
        to be converted by PMX, the MusixTeX preprocessor, into the
        MusixTeX format. This in turn needs the MusixTeX program, which
        generates DVI files. Those can be displayed or printed directly, but
        probably one wants to convert them to PDF. So another program is
        required. Last, a viewer for PDF files is required in order to
        display the sheet music. For the optionally MIDI files a MIDI
        player is required.</p>
        <p>The software requirements are:
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Python interpreter</li>
                <li>PMX</li>
                <li>MusixTeX (normally comes with PMX)</li>
                <li>DVI to PDF converter (pdfdvi for instance)</li>
                <li>PDF viewer (evince or so)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
